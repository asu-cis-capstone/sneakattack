##Elevator Pitch:
A problem that some people face is having to suffer the embarrassment of not having the "hip" and "cool" new shoes that come out. They have to go about their day envious of those who are able to show off their new kicks, wishing that somehow, someway, they might be able to be as cool. There is a way! With the SneakAttack, you can spend less time dealing with typing the billing information, and more time enjoying looking at the confirmation email you'll get immediately when you use our app!

###Measurement Plan:
*The time it needs to process an order as well as the overall usability. We plan on collecting the data from students located throughout campus. We plan on at least getting a sample size of 10-20 particpants, on the two measurements.
