#SneakAttack
Repo for team SneakAttack

##Elevator Pitch:
A problem that some people face is having to suffer the embarrassment of not having the "hip" and "cool" new shoes that come out. They have to go about their day envious of those who are able to show off their new kicks, wishing that somehow, someway, they might be able to be as cool. There is a way! With the SneakAttack, you can spend less time dealing with typing the billing information, and more time enjoying looking at the confirmation email you'll get immediately when you use our app!

##Measurement Plan:
The time it needs to process an order as well as the overall usability. We plan on collecting the data from students located throughout campus. We plan on at least getting a sample size of 10-20 particpants, on the two measurements.

##Sprint Review #1:
Transition from Mobile App to Chrome Extension
As a group, we decided to utilize a chrome extension for the overall inital design purposes prior to attempting to implementing a moble app for this project. We do intend to try and configure an app at a later date. We still have a general mockup of the design concepts of the mobile app. For the review, we went over our mobile app, how it would/will look, and talked about our future plans and goals towards completing this app.

##Sprint Review #2: 
We successfully created a prototype version 1.1 of the SneakAttack chrome extension. This is an extension that can be installed on any chrome browser that when used, will store the data locally from the user, which can then be used to purchase sneakers.
We also collected data from individuals who are "sneaker-enthusiasts", or people who really like shoes. We asked them multiple questions regarding about how they obtain new information regarding when new sneakers come out, how they go about making purchases, and what their thoughts are about our prototype.

##Sprint Review #3:
We updated the logo with a more modern, sleek one that can better represent our idea to our targeted audience/customers. We also created a company website that has information about our product, a way they can obtain it, and a way they can subscribe to our newsletter for updates. We also got this to work directly when used with the official Nike Twitter account by adding the number of shoes they desire for the new sneakers when they are announced directly on Twitter.
